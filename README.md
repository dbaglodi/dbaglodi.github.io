## Projects
### 8-bit Music Generation
As a part of my machine learning course, I collaborated with team members to create a music generation model using unsupervised learning. The motivation behind the project was to provide a tool for video game developers to be able to enhance their games with music. We used Jupyter Notebook to create the generator, and we used the TensorFlow library to train our model. We experimented with our model by tuning hyperparameters such as temperature, learning rate, and layers. Our GitHub Repository, including the final report of our project and some of the generated outputs, can be found [here](https://github.com/CasonHarrison/casonharrison.github.io).
### Airline Management System
As a part of my objects and design course, I collaborated with team members to create an airline management system through the unified process, in which we completed the project iteratively. In the first phase, we created UML diagrams and created a skeleton of our classes in Java. In the second and third phases, we added more methods and JUnit tests to our code. In the final phase, we created a user-friendly interface for our code using JavaFX. In the final product, a user would be able to simulate a flight by creating a flight with an assigned airplane and a route from one airport to another, as well as assign passengers and pilots to the flight.
### Group Planning Website
As a member of GT WebDev, I was a part of a project to implement a Group Planning Website. The website consists of a login page, a calendar select page, a join group page, an invitation page, an events page, and a calendar page. The goal was for users to have a synchronized calendar with their groups to make group planning easier, and we used the Google Calendar API to implement that calendar. Our GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/GT-WebDev-Group-Planning/group-planning).
