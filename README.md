## Projects
### 8-bit Music Generation
As a part of my machine learning course, I collaborated with team members to create a music generation model using unsupervised learning. The motivation behind the project was to provide a tool for video game developers to be able to enhance their games with music. We used Jupyter Notebook to create the generator, and we used the TensorFlow library to train our model. We experimented with our model by tuning hyperparameters such as temperature, learning rate, and layers. Our final report can be found [here](https://casonharrison.github.io/).
### Airline Management System
As a part of my objects and design course, I collaborated with team members to create an airline management system through the unified process, in which our project was done in iterations.
